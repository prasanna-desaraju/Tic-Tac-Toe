# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking cells with X or O. The objective is to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing the opponent from doing the same. The game ends when a player wins or the grid is full, resulting in a draw.
